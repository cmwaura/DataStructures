A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items occur at
one end called the "rear" and the removal of the existing items occur on the other end
called the "front". Literally a queue is a queue. Don't over think it.

Queues are important in execution of processes. For instance a uni with 250 students n
has only 30 printers. One day all the students need to turn in their assignments and they
are printing them out. Well each of their jobs will be queued as per how they get to the
printer. So Student A who pressed got to the comp faster than student B will have their
work done first.

In the grocery this concept is known as FIFO: First In First Out
